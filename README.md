# BruteFTP 🔥
**FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is a standard network protocol used to transfer files between a client and a server. It typically operates on port 21 and requires authentication using a username and password. If the credentials are weak or poorly managed, the server becomes vulnerable to brute force attacks.**
